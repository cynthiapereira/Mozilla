== Introdução: Motivação e objetivo ==

Este documento tem como objetivo prover algumas recomendações sobre como uma comunidade Mozilla deve ser para se manter saudável.

O conteúdo é o resultado de várias investigações e aprendizados de experiências passadas dentro das várias comunidades Mozilla assim como de outros projetos de código aberto.

Os tópicos abordados neste documento são:
* Organização e governança: Papéis, regras e código de conduta.
* Integração, engajamento, caminhos e permanência.
* Desenvolvimento colaborativo: Empoderamento e aprendizado.

== Organização e governança ==

O primeiro passo para toda comunidade é formar uma base sólida, e isto seria através de um bom documento organizacional e modelo de governança.

=== Papéis ===

A fim de entender quantas pessoas nós temos disponíveis na comunidade, e quais áreas de interesse podemos cubrir, é necessário ter um censo.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ffd966; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top; background-color: #fff2cc; color: #434343; max-width: 800px">'''Dica:''' Crie e compartilhe um formulário/questionário rápido para obter estas informações: Quem você é? Quais são seus interesses atualmente? Quanto tmepo você pode dedicar por semana?</div>

==== Equipes operacionais ====

Uma vez que se tenha estas informações você pode agrupar as pessoas pela área de interesse e deixá-las decidir pelo menos duas pessoas para coordenar os esforços - para evitar gargalos, é importante ter mais de uma pessoa na coordenação.

Coordenadores de projetos devem estar em contato com as equipes da Mozilla para estabelecer e prover uma avaliação sobre os objetivos e atividades do grupo - pelo menos uma das pessoas deve se comunicar bem em Inglês.

==== Equipe principal ====

From all the people in the community, create a core team to work specifically on community building and decision making. This should be an open call to anyone who can commit to:

De todas as pessoas na comunidade, deve-se criar uma equipe principal para trabalhar especificamente na construção da comunidade e tomadas de decisão. Isto deve ser uma chamada aberta para qualquer pessoa que possa se comprometer à:

* Trabalhar ativamente na formação da comunidade e discussões.
* Ter disponível tempo de resposta de pelo menos 72h.
* Participar de reuniões *online* pelo menos uma vez por mês.

Esta equipe será o grupo que tomará as decisões finais nos assuntos da comunidade e deve ser aberta para qualquer um que trabalhou ativamente por pelo menos três meses na comunidade.

====Decision making====

Discussions and decisions should be transparent to all community, even if just the core team or the functional coordinator have the final word, every community contributor should have a voice during discussions. Have a single/public channel to talk about the community, if your community is medium/large split functional/project discussions to separate channels.

For core team, a simple majority voting should be enough to approve decisions that don’t have a clear consensus during discussions. A supermajority (2/3) should be required to big changes like changing the community rules. Core team should be able to vote during their 72h response time.

This includes working on new functional areas your community was never involved in.</div>
'''Leadership rotation'''

Being a functional coordinator or a core team members shouldn’t be a life time position. These roles should be renewed each 6 months.

* Functional: Current coordinators should present a six month report about the work during the preceding months. Also anyone should be free to present themselves to run a functional team, if more than two people run for coordination, they all should present their plan for the next six-months and the core team should vote to have at least two coordinators.
* Core team: All members should actively show their intention to continue in this position and present their personal plan and goals for the next six months.

People should avoid burnouts and delegate work when possible. Taking a break from leadership positions should be something normal, you can always return when you have time. Vacations are there for a reason, disconnect from the community for a few weeks!</div>
=== Community rules ===

The way the community is structured and decisions are made should be clearly documented on the community portal, this should be a reference for everyone from old to new members.

Anyone in the community should feel free to propose changes to the community, the process could look like this:

* A proposal is opened on the community forum for discussion by a contributor (champion) answering what and why. Minimum six days period discussion.
* Once there is a clear proposal the &quot;champion&quot; will seek at least five other contributors to support this proposal (core team members will be exempt from this requirement )
* Proposal is formally sent to core team, who will discuss, modify (if needed) and vote.

''The Mozilla Reps program has a [https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Proposals proposals SOP] based on the previous example.''

=== Code of conduct ===

All Mozilla communities should follow the global [https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/ Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines] - it should be localized to your language and linked from your community rules.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ffd966; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top; background-color: #fff2cc; color: #434343; max-width: 800px">'''Tip:''' Create a group of people to provide conflict resolution support and document how to get in touch with them as a group or as individuals.</div>
== Onboarding and engagement ==

Having a great experience as a newcomer is the key for success and growth. Having a clear documentation linked from your homepage should be the first step.

=== Documenting ===

What the main documentation page should include:

* Who we are? What’s Mozilla?
* Where is the community, where to go to talk? (IRC, forums, mailing list, github, task manager, social media…). List all the resources a contributor should know about.
* Community rules and structure link.
* What are the main areas and projects the community is working on? List of areas and projects.
* Contributor directory
** Who’s currently involved in the community?
** In which areas?
** Who is the core team and what’s its role?

<div style="border: 1px solid #ffd966; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top; background-color: #fff2cc; color: #434343; max-width: 800px">'''Tip:''' You don’t need to code your own task manager tool. Some communities are using GitHub issues + some fancy UIs like waffle.io to present what each project is working on.</div>
=== Mentors ===

It’s interesting to form a mentors group to help newcomers to find their way into the community. A good recommendation is to provide a &quot;Present yourself&quot; forum where new people can post and ask for help or how to get involved with project X.

&quot;Crowd-mentoring&quot; is encouraged in medium-large size communities to avoid bottlenecks. Anyone from the community should be able to help newcomers, but the mentors group should be able to devote more time to it.

=== Projects and pathways ===

Each project should have its own page describing all the relevant information about it.

* Who is coordinating, how to contact them?
** A public forum or list to ask questions is encouraged, instead of personal emails that could generate bottlenecks.
* What this project is about? Is there a skillset needed?
* How much time (h/week) do I need to help?
* How can I start contributing now?
** List of easy tasks.
** A pathway from easy to medium and large task currently opened.
* Reference material
** What learning materials should I check to improve my skills to help this project?

Everyone in a project should be tracking newcomers questions, projects coordinators shouldn’t be the only ones onboarding new people.

=== Retention ===

Why do people stay in a community? What makes you stay? What are your motivations?

Each person has different motivations to contribute to mozilla, try to understand the motivations for the people in your community.

Some tips:

* Be always public about the importance of everyone’s voice in all discussions. People should feel part of the group, like a family, they should know their opinions and ideas are valuable.
* Promote and establish an open and honest feedback and listening culture.
* Try to include at least 30% of new voices in discussions. Don’t underestimate the value of shoulder-tapping new people and asking them to share their opinion and letting them know how important it is.
* We are humans! Try to have monthly community meetings via videochat or at least audio. This is a closer way to collaborate - email or text-messages are sometimes tricky to interpret.
* Write good documentation, check with people who are not involved with mozilla (maybe your friends or family) to check if it’s clear enough to start contributing without help.

== Contributor development ==

Being part of Mozilla is not about &quot;giving&quot; but also getting value back to people.

Try to understand:

* Why people in your community contribute to mozilla.
* What they would like to learn.
* What are their skills, especially skills they have never used at mozilla, including personal skills.
* What they would like to teach.
* What are their goals for the next months.
* How they would like to be recognized.

=== Empowerment ===

Mentors should be the group focused on empowering people, being in touch regularly with contributors and getting the previous information from them.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ffd966; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top; background-color: #fff2cc; color: #434343; max-width: 800px">'''Tip:''' Do you have a person who is an expert on metrics? Run an online workshop via air mozilla/vidyo/hangout/other about how to use metrics to be more efficient!</div>
Encourage people to work on impactful projects but also projects they are more excited about. Running a local sessions of &quot;Planning for Impact&quot; is a good way for people to understand how to balance impact as mozillians and personal empowerment.

=== Recognition ===

Have in mind what you’ve learned about how people in your community would like to be recognized.

Some ideas:

* Use your regular meetings to do shout-outs and celebrate people and project accomplishments, even the smaller ones.
* Promote an appreciation culture where people naturally say thank you, especially powerful in a public space (social media) where others can also see this recognition.
* Establish a &quot;contributor of the month&quot; article on your blog.
* Publish interviews to individuals on your blog to publicly promote their work.
* Create fun badges to give to people. Per-project badges too.
